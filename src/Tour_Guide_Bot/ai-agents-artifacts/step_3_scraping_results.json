Painting from the burial chamber of\nSennedjem\n, c. 1200 BC\nThe civilization of\nancient Egypt\nwas indebted to the\nNile River\nand its dependable seasonal flooding. The river's predictability and fertile soil allowed the Egyptians to build an empire on the basis of great agricultural wealth. Egyptians are credited as being one of the\nfirst groups of people\nto practice agriculture on a large scale. This was possible because of the ingenuity of the Egyptians as they developed basin irrigation.\n[\n1\n]\nTheir farming practices allowed them to grow staple food crops, especially grains such as wheat and barley, and industrial crops, such as\nflax\nand\npapyrus\n.\n[\n2\n]\nBeginnings of agriculture\n[\nedit\n]\nTo the west of Nile Valley, eastern Sahara was the home of several\nNeolithic\ncultures. During the\nAfrican humid period\n, this was the area with rich vegetation, and the human population in the Sahara had increased considerably by about 8000 years BC. They lived by hunting and fishing in the local lakes,\n[\n3\n]\nand by gathering wild\ncereals\nof the Sahara, that were abundant. The cereals such as\nbrachiaria\n,\nsorghum\nand\nurochloa\nwere an important source of food.\n[\n4\n]\nThe African humid period was gradually coming to an end, and by about 6,000–5,000 years ago it was over. Well before that time, the migrating herders were going to other parts of Africa, but also coming to the Nile delta, where there were relatively few indications of agriculture before that.\nDakhleh Oasis\n, in particular, has been the subject of considerable recent research, and it supplies important evidence for early Egyptian agriculture.\n[\n5\n]\nIt could be considered typical of post-Pleistocene developments in Northeastern Africa in general.\nDakhleh Oasis is located in\nWestern Desert (Egypt)\n. It lies 350\xa0km (220\xa0mi.) from the\nNile\nbetween the oases of\nFarafra\nand\nKharga\n. In Dakhleh, the Bashendi culture people were mobile herder-foragers during the African humid period. They lived in slab-built settlement sites, and open-air sites consisting of clusters of hearth mounds. Elsewhere in the Western Desert of Egypt, Bashendi-like groups have also inhabited the\nFarafra Oasis\n, and\nNabta Playa\n, to the south.\n[\n5\n]\nThe Bashendi used sandstone grinders to grind local wild millet and sorghum.\n[\n6\n]\nAt Farafra Oasis, a goat dated around 6100 BC (8100 cal BP) was found in the Hidden Valley village. At Nabta Playa, remains of sheep/goat and cattle are present beginning about 6000 BC (8000 cal BP). Yet goats and cattle are almost the only Neolithic elements from the Near East that the oasis dwellers accepted. Other cultural developments, such as the lithic industry, originated locally, or at least from within Northeastern Africa.\n[\n5\n]\nFaiyum Oasis\nof Egypt also provides evidence for agriculture from about the same period. Domesticated\nsheep\n,\ngoats\n,\npigs\n, and\ncattle\nare here. Sheep at the site of Qasr El-Sagha is dated at 5350 BC (7350 cal BP), and sheep, goats, and cattle at 5150 BC (7150 cal BP).\n[\n7\n]\nAs for crops,\nemmer wheat\nand\nbarley\nare found in the Faiyum at the sites of Kom K and Kom W, dated ca. 4500-4200 BC.\n[\n8\n]\n[\n7\n]\nPlentiful pottery is found at these sites, but there is little evidence of permanent structures being built.\nThe\nMerimde culture\nis dated from around 4800 to 4300 BC. These peoples came to develop a fully agricultural "

On the desert edge, long lines of donkeys walk across the sand, carrying grain, copper, and incense. In the distance, you can hear the sound of chariots as soldiers and nobles race across the plains, riding horses that have recently become an\nimportant\npart of transport in Egypt.\nThis\nwas more than travel; it was essential for the civilization. The Nile acted as\nEgypt’s\nmain route, while roads, sledges, and clever engineering connected quarries, temples, and faraway places. Without these transport systems, the pyramids could not have\nbeen built\n, trade would not have grown, and\nEgypt’s\nempire would not have survived. Transport in Ancient Egypt was the key force that created a lasting legacy.\nThe Nile River: Egypt’s Eternal Highway\nThe Nile was vital for Egypt, stretching over 1,100 km from Aswan to the Mediterranean. It served as a natural highway and an important cultural symbol.\nReed Boats\n: Early boats made from papyrus reeds were ideal for fishing and short trips.\nWooden Ships\n: During the Old Kingdom, the Egyptians built large cedar ships that were 25–30 meters in length. These boats could carry heavy cargo like stone blocks.\nObelisk Barges\n: In Hatshepsut’s time, barges were nearly 95 meters long. They transported obelisks from Aswan to Karnak, needing thousands of rowers for the task.\nReligious Symbolism\n: Boats were sacred in Egyptian culture. Pharaohs buried funerary boats near pyramids, and the solar barque of Ra represented the sun’s journey each day.\nLuxor Tours & Activities\nLooking to save some costs on your travel? Why not join a shared group tour to explore Luxor, Egypt? Here are some activities you might be interested in:\nLand Transport: Donkeys, Sledges, and Chariots\nThe Nile River played a key role in transportation, but land transport was also important for building, mining, and desert trade.\nDonkeys\n: Domesticated around 3000 BCE, donkeys carried grain, water, and supplies between villages and across deserts.\nSledges\n: Workers used sledges to drag large stone blocks. They poured water on the sand to reduce friction, a method confirmed by modern tests.\nHorses and Chariots\n: The Hyksos introduced horses and chariots around 1600 BCE. Chariots became symbols of military strength and royal power. Reliefs of Ramses II at Abu Simbel show him riding into battle in a chariot.\nCarrying Chairs\n: Sedan chairs were for elites. They were symbols of status and were carried by attendants in processions.\nTraveler’s Tip\n: At the\nLu"
